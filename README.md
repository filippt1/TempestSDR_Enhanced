# Online resources to “Reconstruction of Images Captured by TempestSDR”
This repository contains the used scripts, dataset samples, and the modified TempestSDR.

## Repository Structure
The repository includes:
- [source code of the modified TempestSDR](TempestSDR_Enhanced/)
- [source codes of scripts used for dataset creation](dataset_scripts/)
- [training logs, source codes of evaluation scripts, and dataloader](deep_learning/)
- [sample from the dataset](dataset_sample/)
- [sample inference using trained models](inference_sample/)
- [photo and dimensions of the created antenna and dipoles](antena/)

## Other Files
Due to limited storage, the full dataset is available on [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/datasets/filippt1/TempestSDR_Enhanced_Dataset). The trained models are stored on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zFWvRVtZ-9s4WG3DEF2Kivu6meQ9UQvB?usp=sharing).

The source codes of the training scripts for DRUNet and DnCNN are in the original author’s repository [KAIR](https://github.com/cszn/KAIR).
